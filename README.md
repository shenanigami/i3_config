# i3 config stuffs

I will scrap this repo (and that of my neovim config) later, to create a dedicated dotfiles repo later (maybe fall 2024?).

Basic config.

Minor customizations:
- jkl; -> hjkl , otherwise my vim brain will flip
- for the above to work, needed to change horizontal split from `$mod+h` to `$mod+Shift+v`.
- added bindings for `gnome-screenshot`
